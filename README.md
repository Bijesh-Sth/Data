# Data Model with SQL Operations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) that demonstrates basic SQL operations performed on a dataset. Below is a brief overview of the contents and instructions for usage:

## Content:

- **data_model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains Python code utilizing SQL queries to perform basic operations on a dataset. These operations may include querying, filtering, joining, and aggregating data.

- **DataEngineeringProject1.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains a project on data modeling and database population. It involves the creation of a data model, table creation using Python, and the insertion of data from various datasets into a database. Below are the steps involved in this project:

## Project: Data Modeling and Database Population

This project involves the creation of a data model, table creation using Python, and the insertion of data from various datasets into a database. Below are the steps involved in this project:

### 1. Find Datasets from Various Links

The first step is to locate datasets from various sources. These datasets may be available online, through APIs, or provided by stakeholders. The datasets should be relevant to the project requirements and should contain the necessary information for analysis.

### 2. Build Data Model

Once the datasets are collected, the next step is to build a data model. This involves identifying the entities, attributes, and relationships present in the datasets. A clear understanding of the data structure is essential for effective data modeling.

### 3. Create Tables Using Python

Using Python, tables will be created in a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. The table schema will be designed based on the data model created in the previous step. Python libraries such as SQLAlchemy or psycopg2 can be utilized for this purpose.

### 4. Insert Data from the Files to Database

After the tables are created, the data from the datasets will be inserted into the database tables. This process involves parsing the dataset files, transforming the data as necessary, and inserting it into the appropriate tables. Python scripts will be used to automate this process, ensuring efficient and accurate data population.
